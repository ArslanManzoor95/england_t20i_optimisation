# England T20I Team Optimization

![England Logo](England_cricket_team_logo.svg.png)


## Project Goal

Develop a data-driven approach to explore and select the optimal batting and bowling lineups for the England T20I team, maximizing their chances of success in the 2024 T20 World Cup.

## Caveats

* **Retirement Status**: This project does not account for whether players are currently active or retired. The selection is purely based on historical performance data.
* **Injury and Availability**: Player availability due to injuries or personal reasons has not been considered.
* **Current Form**: The project does not consider the players' current form or recent performance trends, focusing only on aggregated historical data.
* **External Factors**: Factors such as pitch conditions, opposition strength, and weather conditions are not accounted for in this analysis.
* **Role Specifications**: The analysis assumes general roles (batters, bowlers, all-rounders) without delving into specific sub-roles like openers, middle-order batters, or types of bowlers (e.g., fast, spin).
* **Exploratory Nature**: This project is mainly exploratory and intended for academic and illustrative purposes. The results should not be taken as definitive or factual for actual team selection decisions.
* **Data Limitations**: The analysis is based on the available dataset, which may not include the most recent matches or complete player statistics.
* **Simplified Metrics**: The metrics used for optimization (e.g., batting average, strike rate, bowling average, economy rate) are simplified and may not capture all nuances of player performance.

## Methodology

To achieve the project goal, the following methodology was used:

1. **Data Collection and Preparation**: 
   - Historical performance data of cricket players was collected from kaggle (link is provided in the notebook).
   - Data preprocessing included handling missing values, normalizing performance metrics, and creating statistical aggregates of existing data to enhance feature representation.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualized top-performing bowlers and batsmen by specified variables meaningful in cricket, such as batting averages, strike rates, bowling economy rates, and wickets taken.
   - Analyzed distributions and relationships between different performance metrics using various plots and statistical summaries.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Created new features by aggregating and transforming existing data. Examples include calculating batting scores based on runs and strike rate, and bowling scores based on wickets taken and economy rate.
   - Derived additional features to capture player consistency, such as standard deviations of runs, wickets, and economy rates over different matches.

4. **Clustering Analysis**:
   - Applied K-means clustering to group players based on their performance metrics. This helped identify distinct profiles of players, such as high-performing batters and bowlers.
   - Evaluated the clusters to understand patterns and characteristics of each group, which informed the selection criteria for the optimization model.

5. **Optimization Approach**:
   - A Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) approach was used for optimization. The objective function aimed to maximize team performance based on the combined batting and bowling scores.
   - Defined constraints to ensure a balanced team composition, including the required number of batters, bowlers, and all-rounders, as well as a minimum threshold for bowling capabilities.

6. **Implementation**:
   - Formulated the optimization problem using the PuLP library in Python. The decision variables represented whether a player was selected for the team.
   - Solved the problem to identify the optimal team composition, ensuring that all constraints were met while maximizing the overall team performance.

  
## Results
The optimization resulted in a balanced team with a mix of batters, bowlers, and all-rounders. Visualizations were created to illustrate the team's composition and performance.

## Further Work
To enhance this project, the following improvements can be made:

- Incorporate more advanced metrics for player evaluation.
- Use a more sophisticated multi-objective optimization algorithm.
- Extend the model to consider different match formats and conditions.
- Include more recent data and consider players' current form.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how data science and optimization algorithms can be used to make strategic decisions in sports. By leveraging historical performance data and employing an optimization approach, we successfully selected a balanced and high-performing cricket team.
